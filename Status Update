Status Update
I worked on the review of Human Interface and App Store Review Guidelines. Read through the documents and got some insight on how and why apps on the store are the way they are.
I'm currenlty catching up on some Swift work and just brushing up and getting more familiar with the language. Later today, I'm going to get started on the Calculator App and work on that throughout the break. Also going to be doing more progress work on swift and getting more familiar with XCode and its functionalities
